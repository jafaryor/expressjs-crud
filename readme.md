# The basic CRUD ExpressJS app
## Description
Write a simple REST service with CRUD operations for User entity.•To create REST service. Use ExpressJS. The User should have the following properties(you can use __UUID__ as a user identifier (`id`)):
```typescript
interface User {
    id: number;
    login: string;
    password: string;
    age: number;
    isDeleted: boolean;
}
```

Service should have the following CRUD operations for User:
* get user by id;
* create and update user; 
* get auto-suggest list from `limit` users, sorted by matching score and filtered by `loginSubstring` in the login property: `getAutoSuggestUsers(loginSubstring, limit)`
*  remove user (soft delete–user gets marked with `isDeleted` flag, but not removed from the collection).•Store user’s collection in the file.

Add server-side validation for create/update operations of User entity:
* all fields are required;
* login validationis required;
* password must contain letters and numbers;
* user’s age must be between 4 and 130.

In case of any property does not meet the validation requirements or the field is absent, return __400 (Bad Request)__ and detailed error message. For requests validation use special packages like [joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) and [express-joi-validation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-joi-validation).

Also:
* Implement a simple UI for backend interaction.
* Cover the backend code with unit tests.


## Database
No Database is used in the project. Instead all data is stored in a file as a text.

## Generator
The project is generated by [express-generator-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-generator-typescript).
